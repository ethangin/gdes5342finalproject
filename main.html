        This is Tom Brady: seven-time Super Bowl champion, five-time Super
        Bowl MVP, and one of the winningest quarterbacks of the modern era,
        just to name a few achievements. Whenever he decides to retire, he is
        certain to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer and an unforgettable
        legend. <br><br>But how did he get here, and what else has helped shape his
        story as he has become “The GOAT”?

          Tom Brady entered the NFL as a relatively unheralded quarterback. He
          was drafted by the New England Patriots in the sixth round with the
          199th pick. His scouting report included downsides such as his size,
          physical build, and lack of mobility or a strong arm.

        <p class="career_text">
          Brady wouldn’t get a chance to start until 2001, when Patriots
          starter Drew Bledsoe suffered an injury in Week 1 (pictured above).
          Brady entered the game and never gave back the starting job. He would
          go on to lead the Patriots to an 11-5 record and an AFC East title.

        <p class="career_text">
          Brady led the Patriots to the Super Bowl in his first season as a
          starter, where they defeated the St. Louis Rams, known as the
          “Greatest Show On Turf”, by a score of 20-17 (pictured above). With a
          final stat line of 16/27 passes completed for 145 yards and a
          touchdown, Brady was named the Super Bowl MVP.

        <p class="career_text">
          Brady then led the Patriots to back-to-back Super Bowl victories in
          the 2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons, defeating Jake Delhomme’s Carolina
          Panthers in 2004 (pictured above) and Donovan McNabb’s Philadelphia
          Eagles in 2005. Brady also was named the Super Bowl MVP in 2004.

        <p class="career_text">
          The Patriots were having a historic season in 2008. With an explosive
          offense that was the best in the league and a top-10 scoring defense,
          the Patriots went undefeated in the regular season. It seemed like no
          one could stop them from winning the Super Bowl, either...until Eli
          Manning led the New York Giants to a stunning 17-14 victory, capped by
          David Tyree’s legendary “helmet catch” (above).

          Fresh off their Super Bowl loss to the Giants, the Patriots were
          ready to dominate the NFL again in the 2008-09 season. However, in
          Week 1, Tom Brady tore his ACL, which would sideline him for the
          entire season.

          After a few relatively quiet years, the Patriots returned to the
          Super Bowl in the 2011-2012 season after a 13-3 regular season.
          However, they were upset yet again by Eli Manning’s Giants after a
          critical series of catches by receiver Mario Manningham (above) to
          seal a comeback victory.

        <p class="career_text">
          In 2015, Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick, and the Patriots came under
          fire for allegedly deflating footballs during the playoffs, making
          them easier to grip and throw (also known as Deflategate). Despite
          the controversy, he was allowed to proceed in the playoffs and the
          Super Bowl that season, although he would be suspended for the first
          four games of the next season.

        <p class="career_text">
          In the Super Bowl immediately after Deflategate started, the Patriots
          defeated the “Legion of Boom” Seattle Seahawks after a questionable
          playcall by the Seahawks to pass the ball from the Patriots 1-yard
          line instead of handing off to their star running back Marshawn Lynch.
          Instead, Malcolm Butler picked off Russell Wilson, leading to another
          Patriots Super Bowl victory and another MVP award for Tom Brady.

          Brady again led the Patriots to the Super Bowl in the 2016-17 season.
          After falling behind 28-3 to the Atlanta Falcons at halftime, the
          Patriots scored 31 unanswered points in the second half for a
          comeback victory and yet another Super Bowl MVP for Brady.

          The Patriots again made the Super Bowl during the 2017-18 season, as
          Brady sought his sixth Super Bowl victory. However, they were
          defeated by the Philadelphia Eagles and backup quarterback Nick Foles,
          leading to questions about if Brady was nearing the end of the career
          and how much he had left in the tank.

          The Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl of the
          2018-19 season with a final score of 10-3. With both teams sporting
          excellent defenses, neither offense was able to make much progress.
          This only added to the questions about Brady’s ability to continue
          playing at a the high level expected of him.

        <p class="career_text">
          After the 2019-20 season, Brady left the Patriots in free agency and
          joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with his former star tight end Rob
          Gronkowski (pictured above), where he led the team to another Super
          Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and rising superstar Patrick
          Mahomes. His performance of 21/29 completions for 201 yards and 3
          touchdowns, Brady won his fifth Super Bowl MVP and seventh Super Bowl
          Victory, both of which are easily the most in history for any player.

        <p class="compare_intro_text" id="compare_intro_text">
          Brady has had a great career so far, and, depending on who you ask,
          could potentially keep playing for quite a few more years. <br><br>

          But are there other factors that have allowed Brady to succeed and
          win when other great QBs have existed during his career? To answer
          this, it’s helpful to look at the numbers surrounding Brady, as well
          as the stats of three other Hall of Fame-caliber quarterbacks during
          Brady’s career: Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, and Aaron Rodgers.

        <img src="images/defense_rank.jpg" class="graph"/>
        <p class="compare_text">
          Brady has benefitted from having a good to great defense behind him
          most years. For example, during the seven years where he won a Super
          Bowl, his defense ranked between the fifth and sixth best for points
          allowed, with that number decreasing to about the seventh best when
          considering all his years. <br><br>

          Compare that with Peyton Manning’s Colts from 2001-2011, Drew Brees’
          Saints from 2006-2020, and Aaron Rodgers’ Packers from 2005-2020, who
          all have defenses that, on average, are middle-of-the-pack or worse.

        <img src="images/salary_rank.jpg" class="graph"/>
        <p class="compare_text">
          Brady has also been willing to take pay cuts and restructure his
          contract many times. This has given his team a distinct advantage; on
          average, his teams were able to spend $1-3 million more on free
          agents than the other quarterbacks. This is also helped by the fact
          that his wife was one of the world’s richest supermodels for a long
          time, but his salary cap hit is significantly below other
          quarterbacks of his caliber, which has affected his teams
          significantly. <br><br><br><br><br>

        <p class="conclusion_text" id="conclusion_text">
          Tom Brady didn’t win seven Super Bowls by accident. He certainly
          deserves credit for his accomplishments. However, they are also
          partially a byproduct of the situations he has been fortunate enough
          to play in, whether that’s a great coach, a good defense behind him,
          or a willingness to take pay cuts. <br><br>

          At the same time, it also takes a great quarterback to win
          consistently in big moments and put up the statistics Brady has, not
          to mention his longevity. <br><br>

          Ultimately, Brady’s successes and situation are innseparable. They
          are both an integral part of his story, and his legacy is all the
          more legendary for it.
